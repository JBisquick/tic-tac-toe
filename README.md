A website to play tic-tac-toe.

**Link to Project:** https://jbisquick.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The tic-tac-toe board is played on an array. By pressing different boxes, the array can be changed and the board will be reloaded. The AI is made using a minimax algorithm, where the harder the difficulty, the more likely the computer will make the correct choice.

# Lessons Learned: 

I acquired the skill of using factory functions and module patterns. I also learned how to make a minimax algorithm.
